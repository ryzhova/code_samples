linked_list.py - tasks were:
- print reverse single linked list
- write function that can find the loop beginning in single linked list
- the same as previous but  function requires O(1) memory and computational complexity O(N) where N is list lenght


linked_list_rand.py - single linked list with additional random pointer. Task was to copy this list without additional memory and computational complexity O(n).
