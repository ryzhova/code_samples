The input data of the service is the text field (for category name) for adding a new category.

The output data of the service should be presented in two pages:

1. Main page. This page should contain a category tree. Category names should be links leading to the pages of the relevant categories. The page should also have a form for adding new categories, containing two fields: the selection of the parent category (an empty value to add to the first level of the list) and the field for entering the category name.

2. Category page. This page should contain breadcrumbs displaying the position of the current category in the catalog structure. The page should also have a category name and a button to delete it and save it. When you delete a category, all subcategories must be deleted.
